# CHIP-8 Emulator

---

## NOTICE:
### I stopped working on this project some time back due to taking a Systems class, the first assignment for which was a somewhat simpler version of this. I plan to pick this back up very soon, excited to dive in with much more knowledge than I had before!

## Trying to make a CHIP-8 emulator from scratch!

This is my first time writing an emulator, so we'll see how it goes! I chose to
write this in C since the emulation itself should be fairly straightforward and I
don't feel like diving into C++ quite yet. Maybe I'll rewrite this in Go one day
